            <h1>The Story of the Chinese Farmer</h1> 
            <h2>11 may 2016, Alexandre Gorius</h2>

        <P> <strong> Once upon a time there was a 
            
            <a href="https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/China" alt="china" data-toggle="tooltip" tagert="_blank">Chinese</a> 
                farmer whose horse ran away. 
                That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. 
                They said,
            <div class= villagers>“We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away.
                This is most unfortunate.” </class></div>
                The farmer said,
            <div class= farmer> “Maybe.” </class></div>
                The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it,and in the evening everybody came back and said, 
            <div class= villagers> “Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. 
                You now have eight horses!” </class></div>
                The farmer again said, 
            <div class= farmer>“Maybe.”</class></div></P>
        
            The following day his son tried to break one of the horses,       and while riding it,he was thrown and broke his leg. 
                The neighbors then said, 
            <div class= villagers>“Oh dear, that’s too bad,”</class></div>  and the farmer responded, 
            <div class= farmer>“Maybe.”</class></div>
                The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, 
                and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. 
                Again all the neighbors came around and said,
            <div class= villagers>“Isn’t that great!”</class></div>
                Again, he said,
            <div class= farmer>“Maybe.”</class></div></p> 
        
        <p> The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, 
                and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is good or bad 

            <em> because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; 
                    or, you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune.</em> 
        </p> 
            
            <br>
            <br>

            <em>Here is this dialog in the form of a table</em>

        <table border="3">
            <tr>
                <td>Event</td>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>  

        <blockquote> 
            <q> Good and Bad are just one perspective. Bananas are good for monkeys, but monkeys are not good for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...
