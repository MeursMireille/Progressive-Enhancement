            <h2>11 may 2016, Alexandre Gorius</h2>
        </header>
            <P> <strong> upon a time there was a 
                <a href="https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/China" alt="china" data-toggle="tooltip" tagert="_blank"></a>Chinese</a> farmer whose horse ran away. 
                That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. 
                They said,
                <div class= villagers> <blockquote style="border-left:red dashed">“We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away.
                This is most unfortunate.”</blockquote> </class>
                The farmer said,
                <div class= farmer> <blockquote> <strong>“Maybe.”</strong> </blockquote> </class>
                The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it,and in the evening everybody came back and said, 
                <div class= villagers> <blockquote style="border-left:red dashed"> “Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. 
                You now have eight horses!”</blockquote> </class>
                The farmer again said, 
                <div class= farmer> <blockquote> <strong>“Maybe.”</strong> </blockquote></class> </strong> </P>
        
            <p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, 
                he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said, 
               <div class= villagers> <blockquote style="border-left:red dashed">“Oh dear, that’s too bad,”</blockquote> </class>  and the farmer responded, 
               <div class= farmer> <blockquote> <strong>“Maybe.”</strong> </blockquote> </class>
                The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, 
                and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. 
                Again all the neighbors came around and said,
                <div class= villagers> <blockquote style="border-left:red dashed">“Isn’t that great!”</blockquote> </class>
                Again, he said,
                <div class= farmer> <blockquote> <strong>“Maybe.”</strong> </blockquote> </class>  </p> 
        
            <p>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, 
                and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is good or bad 
                <em> because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; 
                    or, you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune.</em> </p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>  

            <p>Good and Bad are just one perspective. Bananas are good for monkeys, but monkeys are not good for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...</p>
