            <h1>The Story of the Chinese Farmer</h1> 
            <h2>11 may 2016, Alexandre Gorius</h2>
        </header>
            <P> Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. 
            That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. 
            They said, <blockquote>“We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away.
            This is most unfortunate.”</blockquote>
            The farmer said, <blockquote> <strong>“Maybe.”</strong> </blockquote>
            The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, 
            and in the evening everybody came back and said, 
            <blockquote> “Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. 
            You now have eight horses!”</blockquote>
            The farmer again said, 
            <blockquote> <strong>“Maybe.”</strong></blockquote> </P>
        
            <p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, 
            he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said, 
            <blockquote>“Oh dear, that’s too bad,”</blockquote> and the farmer responded, 
            <blockquote> <strong>“Maybe.”</strong></blockquote>
            The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, 
            and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. 
            Again all the neighbors came around and said,<blockquote>“Isn’t that great!”</blockquote> 
            Again, he said,<blockquote> <strong>“Maybe.”</strong> </blockquote> </p> 
        
            <p>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, 
            and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is good or bad 
            <em> because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; 
            or, you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune.</em> </p>

            <h2>Conclusion </h2>  

            <p> Good and Bad are just one perspective. Bananas are good for monkeys, but monkeys are not good for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...</p>
